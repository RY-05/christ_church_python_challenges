# How do computers recognise songs? 

# Targets:
# Load a song, and then have Python play the song back to you.

# Plot the waveform of the song.

# Plot the logarithm of the spectrogram of your song, against time and frequency.


# Extensions:
# When you calculate and then plot the frequency data, experiment by increasing the time resolution. 
# What do you notice about the `sharpness' of the frequency if you reduce the time step?

# What you observe is related mathematically to a well-known physics phenomenon. 
# Can you identify which phenomenon it is related to?

# A paper detailing a popular song-search algorithm is freely available online. 
# Can you find this paper? How does it use a spectrogram to find songs?
