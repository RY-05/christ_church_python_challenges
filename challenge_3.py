# Targets:
# Search and select the ‘Hello World’ page, then print the ‘Summary’ to the terminal.

# Run frequency analysis (ie count the occurrences of each letter) on the content of the ‘Oxford’ page.

# Create a Wordcloud for the ‘Content’ data from a page of your choice.


# Extensions:
# Starting at a page of your choice, choose a random link on the page, and print the title of the page selected.

# Repeat the above random link selection 20 times, printing the title of each site you visit.

# Estimate how long it would take to read all of Wikipedia by calling pages from this API.
