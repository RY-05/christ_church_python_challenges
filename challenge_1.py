# Can computers be used to create art?

# Targets:
# Plot a circle, using the parametric equation above.

# Find the parametric equation for Fermat’s Spiral (online), and therefore plot the spiral.

# Do the same for the Butterﬂy Curve.


# Extensions:
# Specify and plot 5 circles with diﬀerent sizes and diﬀerent colours.

# For the Butterﬂy Curve, change the script so that the colour of each line segment changes with the x-coordinate.

# For Fermat’s spiral, plot the curve so that the colour gets lighter with the radius of each line segment.
